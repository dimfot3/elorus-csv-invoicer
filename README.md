# Elorus CSV Invoice Importer

Elorus is an online invoicing and business management platform, popular in Greece and other countries, with features that connect to national tax systems like MyData.

Many businesses collect sales data from platforms like Stripe, PayPal, or marketplaces as downloadable CSV files. However, to stay compliant with local tax regulations (like MyData in Greece), they need to generate official, tax-compliant invoices‚Äîoften one by one, which is slow and error-prone.

This tool automates the process:
It takes your exported CSV data and batch-creates real, tax-compliant invoices in Elorus‚Äîsaving you hours of manual work and ensuring your records sync with the national tax platform.

For example, if you run a business that gets paid via Stripe, you can export your monthly payouts as a CSV file and instantly turn those into legal invoices in Elorus with a single command, ready to be reported to MyData.

## Features

‚ú® Batch-imports contacts & invoices from CSV  
üîé Handles new and existing contacts  
üìù Logs skipped/failed rows for audit and retry

---

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Edit `config.yaml`**  
   - üóùÔ∏è Add your Elorus API key and organization ID.
   - üìÑ Choose the correct document and tax IDs (see below).
3. **Prepare your `info.csv`:**
   - Required columns: `name`, `email`, `title`, `money`
   - Example:
     ```
     name,email,title,money
     John Doe,john@example.com,Consulting,120.00
     ```
     - The above can be exported from xls files that many platforms keep like Stripes
4. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   - For testing (no real API calls), use `test_run: True` in `config.yaml`.
   - ‚ö° For real invoices, set `test_run: False` (use with caution!).

## Logging & Error Handling

- üìÑ All logs are saved to `logs/app.log` (rotates automatically).  
- ‚ùå Skipped/problem rows go to `skipped_rows.txt` for review or retry.  
- ‚ñ∂Ô∏è To resume from skipped rows, set `resume: True` in your config.

## FAQ

> **Q: Will it create real invoices?**  
> üü¢ Only if `test_run` is `False`. In test mode, nothing is sent to Elorus.

> **Q: What if something goes wrong?**  
> üõ†Ô∏è Check `logs/app.log` and `skipped_rows.txt` for error details.
